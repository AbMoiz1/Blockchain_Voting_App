   - First run may take a moment to install required packages
2. The voting application will open automatically
3. Follow the tabs from left to right: Register → Vote → Mine → Results

ALTERNATIVE START METHODS:
-------------------------
- Command line: "python run_gui.py"
- If you prefer virtual environment: run "activate.bat" first, then "python run_gui.py"

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Windows 10+ (or macOS/Linux)
- Python 3.8+ (download from https://python.org if needed)
- Internet connection for first-time setup (to install packages)
- No additional software needed
